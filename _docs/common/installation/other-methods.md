### 2. Download from Asset Store
- Go to **Unity Asset Store** (we are working on publishing the package to Unity Asset Store.
After it's published, the link will be available here.)
- Add the package to your account.
- Click "Download"
- Follow further instructions
#### `Pros`
- **Flexibility**: the source code is explicit and possesses its own `Twistapps/RequestForMirror` folder.

Choose this method if you want to experiment with Request's sources yourself.
