### Updating
Don't forget to check for updates from time to time! Periodically we provide some new features
and bugfixes
- In Unity, go to _Window_ ▶ _Package Manager_
- Choose **"Packages: In Project"** at the top of the UPM window.
- Find "_Request For Mirror_" in the list
- Click "_Update_". If an update is available, it will be automatically downloaded.

*(Update button may not be showing in Unity 2020 or below. In this case just remove the package and install it again.)*
